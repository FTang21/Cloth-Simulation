# Final: Cloth Simulation
Name: Franke Tang
UTEID: ft4282

### Running the Code
The implementation is the exact same as the previous projects.
`python make-final.py`
`http-server dist -c-1`
Update the settings/parameter beside the canvas.
Move around with "WASD"
Rotate camera by left clicking and dragging.

### Implementation
Implemented cloth simulation using mass-springs.
Collision is a little buggy.
A lot things I wanted to do, but did not have time.
